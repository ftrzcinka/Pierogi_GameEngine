The game is a very simple battle ship!

There are 24 tiles (4x6) and hidden within the board are two enemy ships. 
One is 2 tiles long and the other is 3 tiles long.
The enemy ship locations are randomly generated and are made sure
to not overlap. They can be next to each other which makes the game tricky.
Their orientation (Vertical/Horizontal) is also randomized.

You can move through the tiles using the Arrow keys and the current tile
you are able to interact with is highlighted in yellow.

Once you are at the desired tile you can press the "Enter" key to shoot.
The tile will change depending if the shot is a hit or a miss, and once
a tile has been shot at it cannot be selected to shoot at again.

Since this is a single player game the amount of shots at the enemy ships
that can be made are limited. If you use up your 15 shots before fully hitting 
both ships, you have lost, and the game title at the top will change to display
if you have either lost or won.
The amount of shots you have left is displayed on the bottom right.

The game can be restarted at any time by pressing the "R" key which also
resets the random places of the enemy ships.
